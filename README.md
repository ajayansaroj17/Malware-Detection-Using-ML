<h2> 1.2. Problem Statement </h2>
<p>
    In the past few years, the malware industry has grown very rapidly that, the syndicates invest heavily in technologies to evade traditional protection, forcing the anti-malware groups/communities to build more robust softwares to detect and terminate these attacks.

<h2>1.3 Source/Useful Links </h2>
  <p>    Microsoft has been very active in building anti-malware products over the years  and it runs itâ€™s anti-malware utilities over <b>150 million computers</b> around the world. This generates tens of millions of daily data points to be analyzed as potential malware. In order to be effective in analyzing and classifying such large amounts of data, we need to be able to group them into groups and identify their respective families.
